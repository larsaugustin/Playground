# Playground

![Screenshot](documentation/screenshot.jpg)

This project is a small browser-based procedural graphics tool. It uses a LISP dialect. The generated output is vector-based. It is the procedural sibling of [Canvas](https://github.com/larsaugustin/Canvas).

It’s great for quick ideas and very portable since it doesn’t rely on any dependencies. The simple interpreter can also be used for educational projects.

I created the tool for myself but chose to make it available as free open-source software. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
